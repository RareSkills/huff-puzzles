 *  COUNT_TIME HUFF EXERCISE
 *
 *  The task is to write within the `MAIN` macro below, functions named `getTimeElapsed` and `getTimeUntil`. `getTimeElapsed` receives the uint256 parameter and counts how much time elapsed since the provided timestamp, it should return 0 if the provided timestamp is in the future
 *
 *  `getTimeUntil` receives uint256 parameter and counts how much time remains until the provided timestamp, it should return 0 if the provided timestamp is in the past
 *
 *  NOTICE: The contract should revert when an unrecognized function is called
